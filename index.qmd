This three-part, hands-on workshop series introduces participants to the fundamentals of extracting insights from textual data using R. In **Part 1: Text Preprocessing**, we focus on cleaning and preparing text for analysis through normalization, noise reduction, stopword removal, tokenization, and lemmatization. **Part 2** will delve into core text analysis techniques, including word frequencies, collocations, n-grams, and visualizations such as word clouds. Finally, **Part 3** will explore **sentiment analysis**, applying polarity scoring and emotion detection methods. Throughout the series, we’ll also highlight important caveats and best practices unique to working with textual data.

## Prerequisites

These lessons are hands-on and are designed to be followed with **R** and **RStudio** open. Before starting, please ensure you have the following software installed:

-   **R**: We recommend R version 4.3 or newer. Download from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"}.
-   **RStudio**: We recommend RStudio version 2023.12 or newer. Download from [Posit's website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"}.

**Check your versions**

-   **RStudio**:
    -   On Mac: Go to `RStudio` -\> `About RStudio`.
    -   On Windows: Go to `Help` -\> `About RStudio`.
-   **R**: In the R console, run:

``` r
#| eval: false
R.version.string
```

**Update R**

1.  Go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} and download the latest version for your operating system.
2.  Run the installer. (You don’t need to uninstall older versions—R will install alongside them.)

**Update RStudio**

1.  Go to [Posit’s download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target="_blank"}.
2.  Download and install the newest version for your operating system.

That’s it! After updating, restart your computer to make sure RStudio finds the latest R.

## Access to Data

For this lesson we will analyze a dataset of social media posts related to the Apple TV series *Severance*. The dataset was collected using [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/){target="_blank"} (via UCSB Library subscription), and it includes posts from the two days following the finales of Season 1 (April 2022) and Season 2 (March 2025). The dataset contains over 5,800 posts stored in a CSV file.

The R project containing the dataset and other files is available for download from this link: [Severance Dataset](https://ucsb.box.com/s/z6buv80wmgqm1wb389o1j6vl9k3ldapv){target="_blank"}. You will need an active UCSB NetID and password to access the file (the same you use for your UCSB email).

## R Skill Level

This level assumes a basic familiarity with `R` and `RStudio`. If you are new to R, we recommend you check out the [Introduction to Data Analysis with R](https://carpentry.library.ucsb.edu/R-ecology-lesson-2024-10-08/){target="_blank"}, particularly the [Introduction to R and RStudio](https://carpentry.library.ucsb.edu/R-ecology-lesson-2024-10-08/introduction-r-rstudio.html) section.
