## Prerequisites

These lessons are hands-on and are designed to be followed with **R** and **RStudio** open. Before starting, please ensure you have the following software installed:

- **R**: We recommend R version 4.3 or newer. Download from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
- **RStudio**: We recommend RStudio version 2023.12 or newer. Download from [Posit's website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

**Check your versions**

- **RStudio**:
  - On Mac: Go to `RStudio` -> `About RStudio`.
  - On Windows: Go to `Help` -> `About RStudio`.

- **R**: In the R console, run:

```{r}
#| eval: false
R.version.string
```

**Update R**

1. Go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and download the latest version for your operating system.
2. Run the installer. (You don’t need to uninstall older versions—R will install alongside them.)

**Update RStudio**

1. Go to [Posit’s download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
2. Download and install the newest version for your operating system.

That’s it! After updating, restart your computer to make sure RStudio finds the latest R.

## Access to Data

For this lesson we will analyze a dataset of social media posts related to the Apple TV series *Severance*. The dataset was collected using [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/) (via UCSB Library subscription), and it includes posts from the two days following the finales of Season 1 (April 2022) and Season 2 (March 2025). The dataset contains ~9,000 posts stored in a CSV file.

The dataset is available for download from this link: [Severance Dataset](https://ucsb.box.com/s/z6buv80wmgqm1wb389o1j6vl9k3ldapv). You will need an active UCSB NetID and password to access the file (the same you use for your UCSB email).

Please download the file `comments.csv` and save it in your RStudio project folder.
