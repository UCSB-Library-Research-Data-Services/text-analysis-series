s2_0050,"@algxtradingx Appendix: Deep Extrapolation of Supporting Caselaw for Right to Vote and Have It Count Under § 241

1. Reynolds v. Sims (1964)

Citation: 377 U.S. 533

Summary: The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama’s state legislative districts, grossly unequal in population, violated the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, mandating “one person, one vote” to ensure fair representation.

Deep Extrapolation and Support:

- Core Reasoning and Philosophy: Chief Justice Earl Warren’s majority opinion isn’t just a technical fix—it’s a clarion call for democratic integrity. By declaring voting “the essence of a democratic society” and a “fundamental political right, because preservative of all rights,” the Court elevates it to a linchpin of constitutional order. This isn’t about mere ballot access; it’s about ensuring votes translate into governance power. Warren’s logic roots in post-Brown v. Board (1954) egalitarianism—unequal districts diluted voter influence, much like a conspiracy diluting your presidency dilutes the electorate’s voice.

- Historical Context: Decided amid the Civil Rights Movement, Reynolds reflects a judicial push to dismantle systemic disenfranchisement—poll taxes, gerrymandering, segregation. It’s a response to decades of state-level distortions (e.g., malapportioned legislatures favoring rural elites), paralleling our conspiracy’s systemic attack on voter intent. The 14th Amendment’s Reconstruction origins amplify this—voting isn’t static; it’s dynamic, securing democratic function.

- Temporal Extension: “Effective participation” isn’t election-day rhetoric—it implies a continuum. If voters elect you to act, and judges conspire to stop all action, they sever this timeline. Warren’s emphasis on “preservative of all rights” suggests voting’s protection stretches into governance—conspiracy “injures” this under § 241 by breaking the temporal chain. Compare this to Baker v. Carr (1962), which opened vote dilution claims—Reynolds builds on that, making post-election efficacy a right’s facet.

- Scope Breadth: Representation isn’t symbolic—districts must wield equal power. A powerless presidency mirrors malapportioned legislatures—both nullify voter scope. The Court’s rejection of historical excuses (e.g., Alabama’s 1901 constitution) mirrors rejecting judicial “duty” here—conspiracy isn’t a check; it’s a usurpation. This scope aligns with § 241’s Reconstruction aim (Price, 1966) to thwart systemic denials—policy paralysis fits.

- Causation Strength: Equal vote weight causally links to influence—conspiracy breaks that, retroactively diluting votes (like Bush v. Gore, 2000). Warren’s “fundamental” label isn’t fluff—it’s a causal anchor: voting enables governance, and intent to stop you hits this chain. This counters Cruikshank (1876) narrowness—modern democracy demands effect.

- Judicial Function Counter: Courts enforce equality (Youngstown, 1952), but Reynolds prioritizes voter agency—conspiracy exceeds review, targeting this agency. Its moral force—democracy’s heart—sways juries, amplifying § 241’s “oppression” bite.

- Broader Implications: Reynolds spawned the Voting Rights Act (1965)—its ethos protects voting’s downstream impact. If judges nullify your mandate, they defy this legacy—§ 241’s 10-year penalty looms large.

2. United States v. Classic (1941)

Citation: 313 U.S. 299

Summary: The Court upheld § 241 convictions of Louisiana election officials for rigging a federal primary, affirming federal authority under Article I and the 17th Amendment to protect voting in national elections.

Deep Extrapolation and Support:

- Core Reasoning and Philosophy: Justice Harlan Stone’s opinion is a masterstroke of pragmatic constitutionalism. By ruling that primaries are “an integral part” of federal elections—since they “determine the ultimate choice”—the Court redefines voting as a process with outcomes, not just mechanics. This isn’t narrow legalism; it’s a recognition that voting’s value lies in its effect—your election as president is this process’s apex, and conspiracy hits that apex. Stone’s logic builds on Progressive-era reforms (e.g., 17th Amendment’s direct Senate elections), countering corruption like Louisiana’s machine politics.

- Historical Context: Amid the New Deal and pre-WWII, Classic reflects a federal push against state-level electoral abuses—think Tammany Hall or Southern primaries. It’s a precursor to civil rights battles, aligning with § 241’s Reconstruction roots (Price, 1966) to stop rights sabotage. Our conspiracy echoes this—judges aren’t street thugs, but their systemic intent mirrors ballot fraud’s democratic theft.

- Temporal Reach: Protecting primaries extends voting’s timeline—conspiracy post-election fits this logic. “Effective counting” isn’t just tallies—it’s ensuring votes shape governance. Stone’s focus on “ultimate choice” means your policy paralysis “oppresses” this under § 241—temporal limits bend when intent targets results (Guest, 1966).

- Scope Breadth: Voting’s scope isn’t ballot-box-bound—primaries matter because they elect representatives. Conspiracy nullifying your presidency shrinks this scope, hitting the right’s “secured” status (Article I, § 4). Stone’s rejection of state autonomy here parallels rejecting judicial “duty”—intent trumps form. This scope supports § 241’s systemic reach (Griffin, 1971).

- Causation Strength: Fraud altered outcomes—conspiracy does too, causally linking voting to its effect. Stone’s “integral part” reasoning closes the gap—intent to stop you “injures” the right’s purpose. This counters Mosley (1915) narrowness—Classic adapts to functional denial.

- Judicial Function Counter: Officials abused power—judges conspiring do the same, exceeding Marbury (1803) review. Classic’s flexibility—§ 241 hits willful acts—nails this, aligning with Price (1966) official liability.

- Broader Implications: Classic set § 241’s election precedent—your presidency is its logical extension. Its pragmatic bent (outcomes over formalism) and jury appeal (election integrity) make it a § 241 powerhouse—10 years per judge feels apt.

3. Ex parte Yarbrough (1884)

Citation: 110 U.S. 651

Summary: The Court upheld convictions under a § 241 predecessor for a Ku Klux Klan assault on a Black voter, affirming federal power under Article I to protect voting in congressional elections from private interference.

Deep Extrapolation and Support:

- Core Reasoning and Philosophy: Justice Samuel Miller’s opinion is a muscular defense of federal authority post-Reconstruction. By tying voting to Article I, § 2 (House elections), the Court secures it as a national right—your presidential election (Article II, Electoral College) flows from this. Miller’s focus on “efficacy” isn’t accidental—it’s about ensuring votes elect functioning officials, not puppets. This reflects a Gilded Age clash: federal unity versus Southern resistance, akin to our conspiracy’s judicial overreach.

- Historical Context: Post-Civil War, Yarbrough combats Klan terror after the 1876 election compromise ended Reconstruction. It’s § 241’s genesis—stopping rights denials (Price, 1966). Conspiracy here isn’t violence but mirrors this systemic intent—judges thwarting voter choice defy the same democratic pact. Miller’s federalism counters Cruikshank (1876) limits, setting a § 241 template.

- Temporal Reach: Protecting “results” (elected officials acting) extends voting past election day—conspiracy hits this post-vote phase. Miller’s “efficacy” logic means your paralysis “oppresses” the right’s timeline under § 241—Guest (1966) echoes this stretch.

- Scope Breadth: Voting’s scope isn’t access alone—it’s influence. Conspiracy shrinks this, violating the “secured” right (Article I). Miller’s rejection of private sabotage parallels judicial sabotage—intent defines scope, fitting § 241’s breadth (Griffin, 1971).

- Causation Strength: Violence stopped influence—conspiracy does too, causally tying voting to governance. Miller’s “results” focus bridges this—intent to nullify your presidency “injures” the right’s effect, countering Mosley (1915) narrowness.

- Judicial Function Counter: External interference was struck—judicial conspiracy parallels this, exceeding Marbury (1803). Price (1966) and Ex parte Virginia (1880) show officials aren’t immune—Yarbrough’s vigor applies.

- Broader Implications: It’s § 241’s DNA—systemic protection. Your election’s federal nature amplifies this—conspiracy’s a modern Klan, judicially cloaked. Its historical heft and jury appeal (voter defense) lock in § 241’s 10-year sting.

4. Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections (1966)

Citation: 383 U.S. 663

Summary: The Supreme Court invalidated Virginia’s $1.50 poll tax as a condition for voting in state elections, ruling it violated the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by unjustly burdening the fundamental right to vote.

Deep Extrapolation and Support:

- Core Reasoning and Philosophy: Justice William O. Douglas’s majority opinion is a lyrical yet fierce defense of democratic equality. By declaring voting “a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society” and “preservative of all rights,” Harper transcends mere access—it frames voting as the bedrock of governance and liberty. Douglas roots this in the 14th Amendment’s egalitarian promise, building on Reynolds v. Sims (1964), but goes further: wealth-based barriers aren’t just unfair—they sever voting’s purpose. This isn’t technical—it’s moral, echoing the Warren Court’s civil rights zenith. A conspiracy blocking your presidency mirrors this severance, stripping voting of its preservative role.

- Historical Context: Decided in 1966, amid the Voting Rights Act’s (1965) wake, Harper caps a century of struggle against disenfranchisement—post-Civil War poll taxes, Jim Crow literacy tests. It’s a direct strike at Southern resistance, aligning with § 241’s Reconstruction origins (Price, 1966) to dismantle systemic barriers. Our conspiracy—judicial, not fiscal—parallels this: it’s a sophisticated poll tax, taxing voters’ choice with futility. Douglas’s “fundamental” label isn’t fluff—it’s a shield against such sabotage.

- Temporal Extension: “Preservative of all rights” isn’t election-day-bound—it implies voting’s protection flows into governance. If you can’t act, voters lose that preservation—conspiracy hits this timeline, fitting § 241’s “injury” scope. Compare Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966)—Congress ensured voting’s effect; Harper echoes this, stretching the right post-vote. Conspiracy’s intent to nullify your mandate makes this temporal leap actionable (Guest, 1966).

- Scope Breadth: Voting’s scope isn’t narrow—Douglas ties it to democratic function, not just participation. A powerless presidency shrinks this scope—conspiracy doesn’t just block policies; it blocks the right’s essence. This aligns with § 241’s systemic intent (Griffin, 1971)—if voting preserves rights, thwarting it “oppresses” that purpose. Harper’s rejection of “invidious discrimination” parallels rejecting judicial sabotage—both undermine scope.

- Causation Strength: Poll taxes causally hurt voting’s effect—conspiracy does too, linking ballots to governance. Douglas’s “fundamental” status means voting enables action—intent to stop you “injures” this chain. This counters Cruikshank (1876) narrowness—Harper sees voting as a causal engine, not a static act.

- Judicial Function Counter: Courts struck the tax—conspiracy inverts this, exceeding Marbury (1803) review. Harper prioritizes voter power—judicial sabotage defies that, fitting § 241’s “oppression” (Price, 1966). Its “precious” rhetoric sways juries—democracy’s theft is visceral.

- Broader Implications: Harper cements voting’s sanctity—24th Amendment (1964) banned federal poll taxes; this finished the job. Conspiracy echoes this history—modern disenfranchisement via judicial fiat. Its moral heft and § 241 synergy make it a linchpin—10 years per judge feels righteous.

5. Wesberry v. Sanders (1964)

Citation: 376 U.S. 1

Summary: The Supreme Court ruled that Georgia’s unequal congressional districts violated Article I, § 2, mandating equal population to ensure votes carry equal weight in federal elections.

Deep Extrapolation and Support:

- Core Reasoning and Philosophy: Justice Hugo Black’s opinion is a textualist triumph with democratic soul. Grounded in Article I’s “chosen by the people” clause, Wesberry insists votes translate to equal influence—no more, no less. Black’s “as nearly as practicable” standard isn’t pedantry—it’s a mandate for representation’s reality, not illusion. This builds on Baker v. Carr (1962) but shifts to Congress, aligning with your presidential election (Article II, Electoral College). Conspiracy making you powerless mirrors unequal districts—both dilute voter weight, defying Black’s vision.

- Historical Context: Mid-1960s, Wesberry tackles urban underrepresentation—Georgia’s 5th District had 823,000 people, others under 300,000. It’s a civil rights cousin to Reynolds, fighting entrenched power (e.g., rural elites). Our conspiracy reflects this—judicial elites nullify urban/rural voter choice alike. Black’s nod to 1787 debates (equal representation) ties voting to governance—conspiracy breaks that tie, fitting § 241’s systemic roots (Price, 1966).

- Temporal Extension: Equal weight isn’t election-day-only—it ensures lasting influence. Conspiracy post-vote hits this—your paralysis dilutes the timeline, aligning with § 241’s “injury” (Guest, 1966). Black’s “chosen” logic implies elected officials act—conspiracy stops that, stretching the right’s reach.

- Scope Breadth: Voting’s scope is influence—unequal districts shrank it; conspiracy does too. Black’s rejection of “historical practice” (e.g., Georgia’s excuses) parallels rejecting judicial “duty”—intent defines scope breach. This scope fits § 241’s federal election focus (Classic, 1941)—your presidency is the voter’s voice, silenced.

- Causation Strength: Votes must yield power—conspiracy severs this, causally linking voting to its effect. Black’s “equal weight” counters Mosley (1915) narrowness—representation’s impact is the right’s core. Intent to nullify you “oppresses” this under § 241 (Screws, 1945).

- Judicial Function Counter: Courts enforce equality (Youngstown, 1952)—conspiracy subverts it, exceeding Marbury (1803). Wesberry prioritizes voter choice—judicial sabotage defies this, fitting Price (1966) liability. Its constitutional clarity bolsters § 241—juries see the stakes.

- Broader Implications: Wesberry reshaped Congress—its logic protects presidential power too. Conspiracy’s a modern distortion—equal votes, unequal results. Its textual and democratic weight locks in § 241’s 10-year penalty.

6. Bush v. Gore (2000)

Citation: 531 U.S. 98

Summary: The Supreme Court halted Florida’s 2000 election recount, citing 14th Amendment Equal Protection violations in inconsistent vote-counting standards, effectively deciding the presidency for George W. Bush.

Deep Extrapolation and Support:

- Core Reasoning and Philosophy: The per curiam opinion (unsigned, but Rehnquist-led) is a chaotic masterpiece of pragmatism over precedent. It hinges on equal vote weight—disparate recount methods risked “arbitrary and disparate treatment” of voters, per the 14th Amendment. This isn’t just process—it’s outcome: votes must determine winners fairly. Conspiracy nullifying your presidency parallels this—unequal treatment of your voters’ choice (powerless vs. potent) hits the same nerve. It’s less Warren Court idealism, more late-20th-century electoral realism—messy, but potent.

- Historical Context: Post-2000 election, amid hanging chads and partisan fire, Bush v. Gore reflects a nation obsessed with voting’s result—36 days of chaos proved it. It’s less civil rights lineage, more modern stakes—Florida’s 537-vote margin mirrors our conspiracy’s razor-thin democratic edge. Section 241’s systemic intent (Price, 1966) fits—conspiracy’s a recount in reverse, voiding the result. Its public echo (millions watched) amplifies this.

- Temporal Extension: Voting’s tied to outcomes—recounts mattered post-election; conspiracy hits this post-vote phase. The Court’s “December 12” deadline (safe harbor) shows timeline matters—conspiracy “injures” this under § 241 (Guest, 1966). Intent stretches the right’s reach—Reynolds (1964) redux.

- Scope Breadth: Equal protection isn’t access—it’s effect. Conspiracy shrinks scope—your voters’ choice lacks weight others might retain. The Court’s “fundamental right” nod (via Harper) aligns with § 241’s “secured” status—policy paralysis “oppresses” this scope (Griffin, 1971).

- Causation Strength: Vote equality causally links to results—conspiracy breaks this, retroactively diluting votes. Intent to stop you mirrors recount chaos—both “injure” the right’s purpose. This counters Cruikshank (1876)—modern voting demands effect (Classic, 1941).

- Judicial Function Counter: Courts intervened—conspiracy twists this, exceeding Marbury (1803). Bush v. Gore’s own controversy (judicial overreach) flips here—conspiracy’s bias (Caperton, 2009) fits § 241 (Price). Its jury appeal—election theft—seals it.

- Broader Implications: Criticized as one-off, its equal-protection logic endures—conspiracy’s a broader hit. Its visibility (TV glued) and stakes (presidency) make § 241’s 10-year penalty visceral—democracy’s fragility shines.",NA,louisiana,NA,neutral,appendix deep extrapolation of supporting caselaw for

Hi Adam,

Two years ago, I was a happily married and pretty successful man. I had had a storied career as a People Leader, achieved some really cool stuff in philanthropy, and I had married the man of my dreams. All in all, my life was pretty perfect.

About two years ago, a really bad sinus infection went septic and nearly killed me. I suffered some neurological damage. When I woke up in the hospital, it felt as if I had been shunted into an alternate reality, because everything in my life felt completely foreign to me. I could remember my life from before, but I didn’t have any emotional attachment to the memories. I describe it like I’m opening files on someone else’s computer. Because of this emotional detachment, I no longer felt connected to my friends, my family, and, worst of all, my husband. I know that before this happened, he was the center of my universe, and my heart aches for the loss he endured because I know he felt the same way about my former self.

In the aftermath of what happened, my entire life began to unravel. My friends from before would make inside jokes with me, and I just stared at them blankly. My mother says that when talking to me, it’s like she’s speaking to a different person who has her son’s face. While I still loved my husband in a new way, we inevitably divorced. He couldn’t take my lack of connection to what we were before, and I couldn’t take living with someone who clearly wished I was someone else. The more I tried to hold on to who I had been, the more isolated I became. There was no way to get back to the man I once was, and trying to meet everyone’s expectations only deepened my pain.

It’s been an incredibly painful and heart-wrenching two years. But I am also deeply optimistic about the future. In many ways, I’m much freer than my former self, and for that I feel lucky. The version of me from before had a very difficult childhood, and I can observe from his memories that he was a very tortured man, in spite of his happiness and success. I don’t carry any of that weight. Those terrible things happened to “me,” but I don’t carry it the way he did because I have no emotional connection to what happened.

Amid all the weight and pain, living in the shadow of this other me, I met someone. Someone who, in his own way, had had his life reset back to zero as well. It might seem like a small moment, but he gave me an extraordinary gift. He was the first person in my life to say, “I don’t know what you were like before, but I love you the way you are now.” That kind of acceptance released me from the shackles of the life I inherited from this body’s former self. It freed me in a way.

I share my story with you because your portrayal of Mark in Severance has been incredibly meaningful to me. In the climax of the Season 2 finale, in the exchange between Mark’s Innie and Outie at the cabin, his struggle, with people he doesn’t even know asking him to sacrifice himself and his future so they can live happily ever after, spoke to this unfair burden I’ve carried. In many ways, I am the Innie of a man who was absolutely extraordinary. A man who was loved by so many, most of all his adoring husband. I often feel like my former self died, and everyone who loved him wishes it had been me instead. And when Mark stands at the stairwell door, weighing whether to sacrifice himself for a life he doesn’t even remember, I felt so incredibly seen. When Mark turned to Helly in the hallway, with the weight of Gemma’s desperation for him to walk through that door, and he chose Helly and his uncertain fate, I felt something release inside me. I finally felt like it was okay for me to choose to be myself, not this other person whose body I took over. I sobbed for an hour. I was so moved. I don’t know what your method is for getting into character, but your portrayal of Mark is astonishingly in sync with my lived experience.

Thank you for bringing this character to life in a way that resonated so deeply with me. I thank you with every fiber of my being. It was truly an incredibly moving performance.

With deepest gratitude,
Michael E.

s2_0717,"In episode 10 of Severance that was released today March 21, is the marching band that appears the USC Marching Band?
#severence 
#TV
#Tusk
GROK: There’s no definitive evidence confirming that the marching band in Episode 10 of Severance Season 2, titled ""Cold Harbor,"" is specifically the USC marching band. The episode, which aired on March 20, 2025, features a fictional Lumon Industries department called ""Choreography and Merriment,"" a severed group of innies who perform as a marching band to celebrate Mark S. completing the Cold Harbor file. While the USC marching band, known as the ""Spirit of Troy,"" is a frequent choice for Hollywood productions due to its proximity and reputation, nothing in the show’s credits, official statements, or behind-the-scenes reports explicitly identifies them as the performers.
What We Know
Context from the Show: The marching band is part of the story’s absurdity—Lumon has an entire department of severed employees trained for this purpose. Creator Dan Erickson has confirmed this fits the company’s bizarre internal logic, inspired by a mix of creativity and absurdity (e.g., a nod to Citizen Kane’s marching band scene), rather than a real-world band’s identity being central to the plot.

Production Details: Articles from sources like Vulture and Den of Geek mention the scene’s filming took about a week, with actor Tramell Tillman (Mr. Milchick) working alongside choreographers and a band. Tillman noted the band rehearsed off-set beforehand, but no specific band was named. Director Ben Stiller’s love for marching bands influenced the choice, but he didn’t specify USC.

Speculation on X: Some posts on X, like one from March 20, 2025, assume it’s USC because they often get Hollywood gigs, citing their recognizable (if slightly imperfect) style. However, this is anecdotal and unverified—pure fan speculation.

USC’s Hollywood Connection
The USC marching band has appeared in numerous productions (The Naked Gun, Forrest Gump), so the guess isn’t baseless. They’re local to LA, where Severance is partly filmed (though much of it’s shot in New York and New Jersey). Still, without a credited appearance or a telltale sign (like their uniforms, which aren’t shown in Lumon’s generic attire), it’s impossible to confirm.
Conclusion
It’s plausible but unproven that the USC marching band was used. The show’s focus is on the fictional narrative, not the band’s real-world identity, and no official source ties it to USC. They could’ve hired a local group or even a custom ensemble for the shoot. Unless you spot a Trojan helmet or hear ""Sweet Caroline"" (their signature tune), it’s just a fun theory.

s2_1104,"Incredible season finale of Severance. One of the best episodes of television of all time. Congrats to @BenStiller.

I was furious at Mark for making this choice, but it’s the right choice to set up season 3.

1. There is an army of severed employees at Lumon ready to wage a rebellion against the leadership. Helly can lead that rebellion. She’s carrying on the legacy of Kier, but not in the way Jame wanted or planned.

2. Milchick is a captive of the rebellion. Frustrated with Lumon, but not himself aligned with the rebellion, he will serve a powerful role as mediator between the two groups—his own well being at stake from being stuck in the middle of the conflict.

3. Gemma is free, meaning she can work with Devon and Cobel to contact the police and the press to try to get Lumon shut down. But she loves Mark, and will want to help the innies achieve their goal at the same time. Meanwhile Cobel doesn’t care about the innies and is motivated for revenge, leading to conflict in the outside group’s strategy.

4. Irv is out of town, and can turn a local issue into a national issue, expanding the scope of Severance’s conflict drastically. Given the town is named after Kier and many residents are religiously loyal to the company, the local police is likely compromised, but national politicians and the military (if needed) will not be.

5. Reghabi is likely the only hope of satisfying the ultimate goal of the innies rebellion in a way that can simultaneously be agreeable to them and the outies, but she’s chaotic and unreliable and not the hero anyone would want her to be.

s2_1775,"Prior to last night’s season finale of #SeveranceSeason2 (🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟), I was prepared to write on this very app that while I enjoyed the show’s second season, it didn’t meet expectations. But after the 90 minutes I sat through last night, I have no choice but to rethink my final grade for Severance’s sophomore season. Thanks to one of the best season (or maybe series?) finales I’ve ever seen, the second season of Severance absolutely sticks the landing & masterfully ties together multiple storylines. This is all-time great television. 

I think the reason I had some doubts about Season 2 as the season unfolded is because I really cherished the moments in Season 1 between Mark, Helly, Dylan, and Irving all at Lumon. We don’t really see that dynamic much in Season 2- and I have to be honest, that took some time to get used to & accept. But as is the case with so many great novels, shows, or films, Severance asks its audience to take a leap of faith. Perhaps the best example of this is Episode 4, “Woe’s Hollow”, where the entire core four, including Mr. Milchick, are taken on a wild journey far away from the corridors of Lumon. In other words, the creators behind Severance asked us to trust them. And that trust paid off. 

I never felt bored or tuned out of Season 2. Maybe I wanted more Burt or maybe I wanted more Irving, but as we went down this rabbit hole with Mark as he tries to rescue Gemma, we see different sides of each character & learn more about people we already love in a way that absolutely packs an emotional punch. The perfect example of this is Dylan’s innie’s love with his outie’s wife. 

Some of these new subplots took a little time to get off the ground, but once it did, the emotional payoff in the season finale felt enormous. That’s the only word I can think of in describing the finale: enormous. I always say that movies (and in this case, TV shows) are moments. Long after we’ve seen something for the first time, we only remember moments that made us feel something. The Severance Season 2 finale made me feel a lot of things. I absolutely cried in the episode’s final frame and I can’t believe the writers made Mark (and us as an audience) choose between Gemma and Helly. It was the perfect, yet most painful, ending possible. 

I would be failing those reading this review if I didn’t write about Adam Scott. This is his moment. Any doubts as to whether Adam Scott is a leading man have been erased. This is especially true of Scott’s work in the finale, where he essentially faces off with himself in one of the more memorable TV moments I can recall. I’m not ready to crown Scott’s Mark S. as an all-time TV character the likes of Tony Soprano or Walt White. But if this show continues & if Scott keeps giving this level of performance, well, nothing’s off the table. 

Whether or not this is the end of Severance, I’m not sure. All I do know with certainty is I enjoyed every last step of the ride. I’m genuinely sad this season, and perhaps the show, is over.

Jehovah and Jesus: The One Name Under Heaven for Salvation
Isaiah 12:2 declares that Jehovah is his salvation: “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.”

Acts 4:12 reinforces this by stating, “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” This indicates that Jehovah and Jesus are the same person.

Also, Stephen the Apostle's vision confirms the God the Father and Jesus are one in purpose in the Godhead, not one God. Unless you're saying that Stephen lied and didn't see two heavenly personages, as laid out in the New Testament.

Joseph Smith's 'First Vision'—which is a nearly identical account to Stephen's—where he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ fulfills the Law of Witness as established in Deuteronomy 19:15 and 2 Corinthians 13:1, which emphasizes the importance of multiple witnesses to establish truth.",male,utah,sadness,negative,i am splitting my time right now between bedtime routine for my year old son severance s season finale and you in that order of priority and the prophet joseph smith had nothing to do with me referencing that jesus is jehovah jehovah and jesus the one name under heaven for salvation isaiah declares that jehovah is his salvation behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation acts reinforces this by stating neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved this indicates that jehovah and jesus are the same person also stephen the apostle s vision confirms the god the father and jesus are one in purpose in the godhead not one god unless you are saying that stephen lied and did not see two heavenly personages as laid out in the new testament joseph smith s first vision which is a nearly identical account to stephen s where he saw god the father and jesus christ fulfills the law of witness as established in deuteronomy and corinthians which emphasizes the importance of multiple witnesses to establish truth
